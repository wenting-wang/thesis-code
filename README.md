### Master Thesis - Predicting Court Decision: a Multimodal Deep Learning Perspective

Abstract:

Judicial decision prediction is one of the key research areas in legal technology, which plays an important role in legal assistance and oral arguments strategy analysis. In the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial intelligence, deep learning is springing up in recent years. By building hierarchical structures, deep learning can extract features hierarchically, from the lower level to higher level, and automatically recognise patterns of input data, thus improve the classiﬁcation performance. Multimodel deep learning (MMDL) is a particular deep learning technique based on multiple sources of data. By implementing fusion on data, feature or decision level, it enables the most use of data. In this paper, a feature-level fusion and decision-level fusion experiments based on multimodal deep learning are proposed. It is one of the ﬁrst attempts to apply the MMDL approach to court decision prediction. The cases information of the Supreme Court of the United States and related oral arguments corpus were used for experiments. The result shows that the proposed MMDL method based on multi-source data and fusion techniques outperform machine learning and simple neural network.
